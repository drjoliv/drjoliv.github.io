# Euler with jFunc

I'm creating yet another functional java library, called jFunc. Why would I do such a thing, we already have __cycylops-react__ and __highj__ why would i waste my time creating another one. A better question is why not, and maybe an even better question would be why don't we just all program in __haskell__. But it began by me just trying to grasp concepts in haskell and the funcitonal paradiams presented there in. So all the euler problems solved here will be solved using that java library. __jFunc__. 

## Euler 01

> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
